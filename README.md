SDI, HDMI or DisplayPort channels are currently the only valid types of channels for this application.

OS Support:
- Windows

See https://www.deltacast.tv for more video products.

# How to build

VideoViewer requires some dependencies to be installed on the system:

    cmake v3.20 or higher
    glfw v3.4.0
    Python 3

We recommend using Conan 2.x to retrieve those dependencies:

    conan install . -b missing -pr YOUR_CONAN_PROFILE

As some dependencies are also retrieved through submodules, you will need to initialize them:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## VideoMaster SDK

The VideoMaster SDK is required to build the application.

After installing the SDK according to the official documentation, the libs and headers should be found without further step needed through the `find_package` command.

## Building with CMake

If you used Conan to retrieve your dependencies, you can use the following commands to build the project:

    cmake --preset YOUR_CMAKE_PRESET
    cmake --build build

# How to use

All relevant information regarding the application can be found by running the application with the --help option:

    ./videomaster-video-monitor --help

For example, to run the application with the default settings (same as `--device 0 --input 0`), simply run:

    ./videomaster-video-monitor

To select the device and connector indexes to use

    ./videomaster-video-monitor --device 0 --input 0

Use the device at index 0 and the reception connector at index 0.
